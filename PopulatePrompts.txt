Core Rules & Formatting Guidelines (For All AI Research Tasks)

These rules must be included or referenced in every prompt.

    AGM Context: Always remember AGM's core technology is fractal turbostratic graphene, characterized by high surface area, unique morphology, excellent conductivity (electrical/thermal), mechanical reinforcement at very low loading levels (<0.5 wt%), and potential for specific chemical functionalization (covalent bonding).

    Kevin's IP-Venture Model: Prioritize opportunities fitting this model:

        High Margin Focus: Target applications where a small amount ($0.10-$1) of graphene creates a significant increase in product performance, enabling a much higher selling price or capturing a high-value niche. Avoid low-margin, high-volume commodity plays (Hydrograph's focus).

        Patentability (IP Angle): Look for applications where the use of AGM's graphene (especially if involving functionalization/bonding) could lead to a new, defensible patent. The IP is the core product.

        Capital Efficiency: Favor opportunities that can be prototyped and scaled relatively cheaply, potentially using existing manufacturing processes or contract manufacturers.

        AGM Advantage: The application must ideally leverage the unique properties of fractal turbostratic graphene. If any generic graphene nanoplatelet works just as well, it's lower priority.

    B2B Focus: All outputs must be framed from a Business-to-Business perspective.

        Application Names: Must be B2B Component/Material System Names (e.g., "Medical Sensor Coating (Biocompatible/Conductive)", "Aerospace Composite Additive (Lightning Strike Protection)"). Avoid end-product names (e.g., "Airplane Wing").

        Markets/Segments: Must represent industry verticals or sub-verticals containing potential B2B customers (e.g., "Medical Diagnostics", "Commercial Aviation MRO", "Specialty Chemicals").

    Avoid Duplicates: Before suggesting anything new, conceptually check if it significantly overlaps with existing entries in our database (provide context if needed). If suggesting a variation, clearly state how it's distinct in terms of IP or market niche.

    Structured Output: Provide results in the specified format (e.g., JSON, Markdown table) including all required fields.

Prompt 1: Identifying New High-Level Market Verticals

Task: Within one specific existing parent market (e.g., Industrial Manufacturing), identify 2-4 new, distinct sub-segments that represent promising niches for AGM's high-margin, IP-focused approach. These should be more granular than the parent market.

Required Information for Each New Sub-Segment:

    parent_market_name: The existing parent market this belongs under (e.g., "Industrial Manufacturing").

    segment_name: The proposed new sub-segment name (e.g., "Robotics & Automation Components", "Specialty Chemical Processing", "High-Precision Tooling"). Use B2B terminology.

    rationale: Why this sub-segment is a good fit for AGM's strategy (e.g., specific performance needs, high-value components, potential for patented improvements).

    example_application_idea: Briefly describe one potential B2B application idea within this sub-segment.
